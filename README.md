41127 Software Design Studio

Group 6 for SDS 41127 Friday 9-11am

I am Sean Huynh and I am a team member for Team 6.

This is my individual branch that I will be using to test my code, upload any files involved in the creation of our project "A privacy preserving adaptive testing system". As well as highlighting any contributions that I will give for this project and subject as evidence.
